## Four Magical Numbers

Problem Statement
You are given an array of n integers. Now by choosing any two elements (their index can be same or different) from the array you have to find the maximum and minimum product, maximum and minimum sum from the array.

Input Format

The first line will contain T, the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single positive integer N (size of the array).
The second line will contain N positive integers A1,A2,A3,A4…..An (values of the array).
Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100000
1 ≤ N ≤ 10000
-1000 ≤ Ai ≤ 1000
Output Format

Print four integers in this order, maximum product, minimum product, maximum sum and minimum sum. Don't forget to print a new line after each test case.

Explanation 1

For maximum product here we can take = (A[2]*A[2]) = (17*17)=289
For minimum prodcut here we can take = (A[3]*A[3]) = (10*10)=100
For maximum sum here we can take = (A[2]+A[2]) = (17+17) = 34
For minimum sum here we can take = (A[3]+A[3]) = (10+10) = 20
