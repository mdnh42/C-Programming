# Structure
    - Declare Structure (struct)
    - Designated Initization 
    - Array of Structure
    - Structure Pointer 
    






# Conditional Operator 
 *p = x>y?x:y 
 *q = x<y?x:y

 # One Funcation Return Array Max and Min 
    - Pointer *, SizeOf, Memorry Address 

 # Some Introduction of File 
    - fscanf, fclosef, fopen, "r", "w" 
    - NULL, FILE*, 

# Pass By Value and Pass By References 
    - without address and pointer 
    - with address and pointer. 
    - using pointer theory value change and swapping. 

# Pointer to Pointer 
    - using pointer to pointer 

# Recursion 
    - using funcation calling a function while match base condition. 
    Best Example: 
    Factorial 
    n* fact(n-1)
